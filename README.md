# STM32_SAV_Sound_Lib
STM32 Sound library wrote on CubeIDE with using one timer with PWM out.
The program was developed for the STM32 Nucleo-G031K8 development board

In addition to the library, I added other files to make it easier to understand how to configure a timer to operate PWM on the output for Buzzer.
